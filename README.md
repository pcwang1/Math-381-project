# Math-381-project

Dear professor and our community:

This is the code for our project. You may find the descriptions for our projects. Also there are 7 shapfiles exported from ArcMap software. You nay need to put these shapfiles in the same folder with the codes. Also please use Anaconda 2.7 rather than 3.7. Please input the following commands in the terminal of anaconda before running the code:

conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 pyshp 
conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 shapely
conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 geopandas

Since the files may contain too many pictures, please be patient to wait for opening. Thank you so much! 

If you have any questions, please contact with us. We are very gald to explain about that!

Have a great break!

Peicheng Wang && Yanyan Guan
